# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# puts "Destroy all the movies, lists, bookmarks"
# Movie.destroy_all
# List.destroy_all
# Bookmark.destroy_all

# puts "Creating movie"
# 48.times do
#   Movie.create!(
#     title: Faker::Movie.title,
#     overview: Faker::Movie.quote,
#   )
# end
